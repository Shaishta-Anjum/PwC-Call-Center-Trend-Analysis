# Call Center Trend Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the development of a comprehensive Call Center Trends Dashboard using Power BI as part of the PwC Virtual Internship Program. The main goal is to offer actionable insights to a telecom client, aiming to enhance marketing strategies and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Total Calls**: The total number of incoming calls received by the call center.
   
2. **Answered Calls**: The number of incoming calls that were answered by agents.

3. **Resolved Calls**: The number of incoming calls for which the customer's issue or query was successfully resolved.

4. **Missed Calls**: The number of incoming calls that were not answered by agents and were missed.

5. **Abandoned Calls**: The number of incoming calls that were abandoned by the callers before reaching an agent.

6. **Average Answer Speed**: The average time it takes for an incoming call to be answered by an agent, measured in seconds.

7. **Customer Satisfaction Rating**: The rating provided by customers indicating their level of satisfaction with the service provided by the call center.

8. **Calls by Month**: The distribution of incoming calls over different months.

9. **Calls by Day of the Week**: The distribution of incoming calls over different days of the week.

10. **Calls by Hour of the Day**: The distribution of incoming calls over different hours of the day.

These Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) provide valuable insights into various aspects of call center performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency, helping stakeholders make informed decisions and drive continuous improvement initiatives.

## Insights

- **Total Calls Analysis**: The dashboard reveals that the call center efficiently handled 5000 calls. However, the presence of 946 abandoned calls and 1354 unresolved issues highlights opportunities for improvement in managing peak times and enhancing issue resolution processes.
  
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Despite resolving 3646 issues, the average customer satisfaction rating of 3.40 out of 5 indicates room for improvement. This feedback underscores the need for focused efforts to enhance service quality and meet customer expectations.

- **Agent Performance**: The agent ranking visual, considering calls handled and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores, is valuable for recognizing top performers. Identifying high-performing agents enables targeted training and recognition programs, contributing to overall customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

- **Recommendations**: Based on the insights provided, recommendations include:
    - Strategies to reduce abandoned calls, such as optimizing staffing during peak times and implementing call-back options.
    - Refining issue resolution processes to ensure timely and satisfactory resolution for customers.
    - Leveraging agent ranking insights for targeted training and recognition programs to further enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

These recommendations aim to drive continuous improvement in customer satisfaction and operational efficiency within the call center.
